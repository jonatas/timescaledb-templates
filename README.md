# Timescale Templates

Template to get started with TimescaleDB for financial, IoT, and web traffic time-series data.

Every folder has its own setup and usage:

* [finance](./finance/README.md) folder contains market data processing.
* [sensors](./sensors/README.md) folder contains IoT data processing.
* [webtop](./webtop/README.md) folder contains website traffic analysis.

## What is TimescaleDB?

TimescaleDB is an open-source database designed to make SQL scalable for time-series data. It's optimized for fast ingest and complex queries, making it ideal for finance, IoT, DevOps, and other time-series data applications.

## Finance Market Data

This setup is ideal for anyone working with financial time-series data in TimescaleDB, such as:

- Financial analysts tracking market trends.
- Data scientists conducting financial research.
- Fintech applications requiring real-time market data analysis.


### Prerequisites

To use this repository, you need to have TimescaleDB installed. If you haven't already,
you can find detailed installation instructions on the
[Timescale installation pages](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/getting-started/installation).

Also, to use all the hyperfunctions available, you need to have the
[timescaledb-toolkit](https://docs.timescale.com/self-hosted/latest/tooling/install-toolkit/) extension.

To fastest way to setup both extensions at once on premise is with [timescaledb-ha docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescale/timescaledb-ha) image.

### Setup and Usage

This is a main repository with folders that contains different scenarios. The
setup and usage is inside each folder. For now we have:

The [finance](./finance/README.md) setup your market data processing with:

- A `ticks` hypertable for efficient storage and querying of tick data.
- Continuous aggregates for generating candlesticks.
- Compression and retention policies.
- Utilities for tracking symbol pairs and last prices.

The [sensors](./sensors/README.md) setup your IoT data processing with:
- A configurable system that you can define what is your hypertable name and other details of your data.
- Dynamic SQL for generating Hierarchical Continuous Aggregates.
- Compression and retention policies.
- Example of how to use the system with a sample dataset and with data simulator
    functions generating data using background workers.

The [webtop](./webtop/README.md) setup your website traffic analysis with:
- A containerized solution for analyzing website access patterns.
- Real-time monitoring dashboard for traffic analysis.
- Continuous aggregates for efficient querying of traffic data.
- Job scheduling for data generation and website election processes.
- Support for different traffic patterns (steady, bursty, growing, declining).

## Quick Start

To get started with any of these templates:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the desired template folder (finance, sensors, or webtop)
3. Follow the setup instructions in the respective README.md file

For example, to start the WebTop project:

```bash
cd webtop
./webtop.sh start
./webtop.sh monitor
```
