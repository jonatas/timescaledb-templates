# WebTop

A containerized solution for analyzing website data using TimescaleDB.

## Overview

This project uses TimescaleDB to:
- Record and analyze domain access patterns
- Track the most popular websites over time
- Provide insights via a real-time dashboard
- Test and monitor different traffic patterns
- Simulate AI domain traffic patterns (OpenAI, Claude, Anthropic, Perplexity)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation & Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/timescale/template.git
cd template/webtop

# Start services
./webtop.sh start

# View the monitoring dashboard
./webtop.sh monitor

# Stop services
./webtop.sh stop
```

## WebTop Script Commands

The `webtop.sh` script provides the following commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `start` | Start the monitoring services and run the main database setup |
| `stop` | Stop the monitoring services |
| `restart` | Restart the monitoring services and reapply the database setup |
| `monitor` | Show unified monitoring dashboard |
| `setup` | Set up traffic patterns for testing |
| `setup-db` | Run the main database setup script without restarting services |
| `reset` | Reset the database (clear all data and remove all traffic generation jobs) |
| `help` | Show help message |

### Job Management and Cleanup

The system includes a job management system that:

1. **Centralized Job Cleanup**: 
   - All job cleanup is handled by a single `cleanup_all_jobs()` function
   - Located in `reset.sql` to ensure availability during resets
   - Targets specific job types: data generation, candidate population, and elections
   - **Note**: The `reset` command will remove all traffic generation jobs, including AI domain patterns

2. **Reset Process**:
   - Safely stops all running jobs
   - Cleans up job history
   - Reinitializes only necessary background jobs
   - Preserves system configuration while clearing data

3. **Job Types**:
   - **Data Generation Jobs**: Generate synthetic traffic for testing
   - **Candidate Population Jobs**: Identify potential top websites
   - **Election Jobs**: Select and track top websites over time

4. **Scheduling Flow**:
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
     A[Reset Command] --> B[cleanup_all_jobs]
     B --> C[Clear Data]
     C --> D[Reset Aggregates]
     D --> E[Schedule Core Jobs]
     E --> F[Verify Job Status]
   ```

### AI Domain Traffic Patterns

The system includes predefined traffic patterns for popular AI domains in `sql/setup/ai-domains.sql`:

1. **OpenAI (openai.com)**:
   - Steady high traffic: 300-500 hits every 5 seconds
   - Simulates consistent high-volume API usage

2. **Claude (claude.ai)**:
   - Bursty traffic: 800-1000 hits every 30 seconds
   - Simulates periodic high-volume requests

3. **Anthropic (anthropic.com)**:
   - Growing traffic: Starts with 100 hits, increases by 50 every minute
   - Simulates increasing adoption over time

4. **Perplexity (perplexity.ai)**:
   - Declining traffic: Starts with 500 hits, decreases by 20 every minute
   - Simulates decreasing usage patterns

To apply these patterns:
```bash
# After starting the services
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres -d website_tracker -f /sql/setup/ai-domains.sql
```

Monitor the patterns using:
```sql
SELECT * FROM monitor_traffic_patterns();
```

### Database Setup Integration

The `webtop.sh` script now automatically runs the `main.sql` setup script when starting services. This ensures that:

1. **Complete Database Initialization**: All necessary tables, views, and functions are created
2. **Initial Test Data**: Sample data is generated for popular websites
3. **Job Scheduling**: All required background jobs are scheduled with appropriate intervals
4. **Election Process**: The website election process is configured and started

You can also run just the database setup without restarting services using the new `setup-db` command:

```bash
$ ./webtop.sh setup-db
Running main database setup script...
Main setup script completed successfully!
Use ./webtop.sh monitor to see real-time statistics
```

This is useful when you want to reapply the database setup without disrupting running services.

```sql
-- Analyze burst patterns over time
SELECT time_bucket('1 minute', time) as minute,
       domain,
       COUNT(*) as requests,
       CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 1000 THEN 'BURST' ELSE 'NORMAL' END as traffic_state
FROM logs
WHERE domain = 'bursty-traffic.com'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 10;

         minute         |       domain       | requests | traffic_state 
------------------------+--------------------+----------+---------------
 2025-04-28 22:13:00+00 | bursty-traffic.com |      541 | NORMAL
 2025-04-28 22:12:00+00 | bursty-traffic.com |     1381 | BURST
 2025-04-28 22:11:00+00 | bursty-traffic.com |     4336 | BURST
 2025-04-28 22:10:00+00 | bursty-traffic.com |    10032 | BURST
 2025-04-28 22:09:00+00 | bursty-traffic.com |     7009 | BURST
 2025-04-28 22:08:00+00 | bursty-traffic.com |     1016 | BURST
 2025-04-28 22:07:00+00 | bursty-traffic.com |     1000 | NORMAL

```

Key configurations:
- Data retention: 30 minutes
- Traffic generation: Every minute
- Base traffic: 1000 requests/minute
- Burst probability: 40%
- Burst multiplier: 10x
</details>

### 5. Understanding Traffic Patterns

The system supports different types of traffic patterns to simulate real-world scenarios:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Patterns["Traffic Patterns"]
        Steady["Steady<br/>Constant rate"]
        Bursty["Bursty<br/>Spikes of traffic"]
        Growing["Growing<br/>Increasing rate"]
        Declining["Declining<br/>Decreasing rate"]
    end
    
    subgraph Examples["Example Patterns"]
        Steady --> |"1000 req/min"| SteadyEx["Steady Line"]
        Bursty --> |"1000 req/min + bursts"| BurstyEx["Spiky Line"]
        Growing --> |"+100 req/min"| GrowingEx["Upward Line"]
        Declining --> |"-100 req/min"| DecliningEx["Downward Line"]
    end
```

#### What is Bursty Traffic?
Bursty traffic refers to a pattern where traffic levels suddenly spike above the normal baseline. This is common in real-world scenarios such as:
- Breaking news causing sudden website traffic increases
- Social media posts going viral
- Scheduled events (e.g., product launches, ticket sales)
- Flash sales or promotions

The bursty pattern in our system is characterized by:
- **Base Traffic**: Normal, steady traffic level (e.g., 1000 requests/minute)
- **Burst Probability**: Chance of a burst occurring (e.g., 40% chance every minute)
- **Burst Multiplier**: How much traffic increases during a burst (e.g., 10x normal traffic)

### 6. Analyzing Traffic Patterns

<details>
<summary>View detailed traffic analysis</summary>

```sql
-- Analyze burst patterns
SELECT 
    time_bucket('1 minute', timestamp) as minute,
    domain,
    COUNT(*) as requests,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) > 1000 THEN 'BURST'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as traffic_state
FROM logs
WHERE domain = 'bursty-traffic.com'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 10;

 minute           | domain            | requests | traffic_state 
-----------------+-------------------+----------+---------------
 2024-03-20 10:15| bursty-traffic.com| 36621    | BURST
 2024-03-20 10:14| bursty-traffic.com| 1000     | NORMAL
 2024-03-20 10:13| bursty-traffic.com| 1000     | NORMAL
 2024-03-20 10:12| bursty-traffic.com| 10000    | BURST
 2024-03-20 10:11| bursty-traffic.com| 1000     | NORMAL
```
</details>

### 7. Configuration Options

<details>
<summary>View and modify system configuration</summary>

```sql
-- View current retention policy
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.jobs 
WHERE proc_name = 'policy_retention';

-- Modify retention period
SELECT add_retention_policy('logs', INTERVAL '2 hours');

-- Adjust chunk interval
SELECT set_chunk_time_interval('logs', INTERVAL '30 minutes');
```
</details>

## Architectural Advantages

### Data Retention and Management
- **Automatic Data Retention**: The system automatically drops logs older than 1 hour, keeping the database size manageable
- **Chunk Time Intervals**: Data is partitioned into 20-minute chunks for efficient querying and management
- **Continuous Aggregates**: Pre-computed aggregations improve query performance for historical analysis

### Scalability Features
- **Hypertable Partitioning**: Data is automatically partitioned by time, allowing for efficient querying of recent data
- **Auto-Tuning Configurations**: The system automatically adjusts to changing traffic patterns
- **Responsive Election Process**: Considers both total and recent traffic for accurate rankings

### Monitoring Capabilities
- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis**: Monitor traffic levels (High, Medium, Low) and trends (Growing, Declining, Stable)
- **Burst Detection**: Identify and analyze traffic bursts with configurable probability and magnitude
- **Historical Comparisons**: Compare current traffic with historical patterns

## Advanced Features

### Continuous Aggregates

The system uses continuous aggregates to efficiently analyze traffic patterns at different time scales:

<details>
<summary>View continuous aggregate configurations</summary>

```sql
-- View all continuous aggregates
SELECT 
    hypertable_schema,
    hypertable_name,
    view_schema,
    view_name,
    view_definition,
    refresh_policy
FROM timescaledb_information.continuous_aggregates;

-- Example output:
 hypertable_schema | hypertable_name | view_schema | view_name | refresh_policy
------------------+-----------------+-------------+-----------+---------------
 public           | logs           | public      | traffic_patterns_monitor | {"start_offset": "1 hour", "end_offset": "1 minute", "schedule_interval": "1 minute"}

-- View refresh policy details
SELECT 
    view_name,
    schedule_interval,
    start_offset,
    end_offset,
    next_start
FROM timescaledb_information.jobs
WHERE proc_name = 'policy_refresh_continuous_aggregate';
```

The continuous aggregates are configured with:
- **Refresh Schedule**: Every minute
- **Lookback Window**: 1 hour
- **Data Retention**: 30 minutes
- **Hierarchical Aggregation**: 
  1. Raw logs â†’ 1-minute aggregates
  2. 1-minute aggregates â†’ 5-minute aggregates
  3. 5-minute aggregates â†’ hourly aggregates
</details>

### Hypertable Partitioning

The system uses TimescaleDB's hypertable partitioning for efficient data management:

<details>
<summary>View hypertable configuration</summary>

```sql
-- View hypertable information
SELECT 
    hypertable_schema,
    hypertable_name,
    compression_enabled,
    compression_segmentby,
    compression_orderby,
    chunk_time_interval
FROM timescaledb_information.hypertables;

-- Example output:
 hypertable_schema | hypertable_name | compression_enabled | chunk_time_interval
------------------+-----------------+--------------------+--------------------
 public           | logs           | true               | 20 minutes

-- View chunk information
SELECT 
    chunk_name,
    range_start,
    range_end,
    is_compressed,
    compression_status
FROM timescaledb_information.chunks
WHERE hypertable_name = 'logs'
ORDER BY range_start DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Example output:
     chunk_name     |      range_start      |       range_end       | is_compressed | compression_status
--------------------+----------------------+----------------------+---------------+------------------
 _hyper_1_1_chunk  | 2024-03-20 10:00:00  | 2024-03-20 10:20:00  | true          | Compressed
 _hyper_1_2_chunk  | 2024-03-20 10:20:00  | 2024-03-20 10:40:00  | false         | Uncompressed
 _hyper_1_3_chunk  | 2024-03-20 10:40:00  | 2024-03-20 11:00:00  | false         | Uncompressed
```

Key partitioning features:
1. **Chunk Time Interval**: 20 minutes
2. **Compression**:
   - Enabled after 1 hour
   - Segment by: domain
   - Order by: time DESC
3. **Retention Policy**: 
   - Drops chunks older than 1 hour
   - Automatically removes compressed chunks
</details>

### Hierarchical Data Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Raw Logs<br/>20-min chunks] --> B[10-min Aggregates<br/>domain_stats_10m]
    B --> C[1-day Aggregates<br/>domain_stats_1d]
    B --> D[Candidates<br/>populated hourly]
    D --> E[Long-term Storage<br/>elected daily]
    A --> F[Active Data<br/><1 hour]
    A --> G[Dropped Data<br/>>1 hour]
```

The data flow follows these key stages:

1. **Raw Data Collection**:
   - Logs are stored in 20-minute chunks
   - Real-time ingestion of domain access data
   - Automatic chunk creation and management

2. **Continuous Aggregation**:
   - **10-minute Aggregates** (`domain_stats_10m`):
     - Refreshes every 5 minutes
     - Keeps last 7 days of data
     - Base level for detailed analysis
   - **1-day Aggregates** (`domain_stats_1d`):
     - Refreshes every hour
     - Keeps last 90 days of data
     - Used for long-term trends

3. **Candidate Processing**:
   - **Hourly Population**:
     - Identifies domains meeting minimum hit threshold
     - Uses appropriate aggregation level based on election window
     - Maintains candidate list for 7 days
   - **Daily Election**:
     - Elects top websites based on weighted scoring
     - Updates long-term storage
     - Maintains historical rankings

4. **Data Lifecycle**:
   - **Active Data** (<1 hour):
     - Real-time querying
     - Immediate aggregation
   - **Retention** (>1 hour):
     - Automatic chunk dropping via retention policy
     - Maintains system performance
     - Preserves storage efficiency

FROM timescaledb_information.job_stats
WHERE proc_name IN (
    'policy_retention',
    'policy_compression',
    'policy_refresh_continuous_aggregate'
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Database Connection Issues

**Problem**: The `webtop.sh start` command fails with connection errors.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if Docker is running
docker ps

# If Docker is not running, start it
# On macOS: Open Docker Desktop
# On Linux: sudo systemctl start docker

# If the container is running but not healthy, restart it
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

#### 2. No Data in the Monitoring Dashboard

**Problem**: The monitoring dashboard shows no traffic data.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if data generation jobs are running
./webtop.sh setup-db

# Verify job status
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres -c "SELECT job_id, proc_name, schedule_interval FROM timescaledb_information.jobs WHERE proc_name LIKE 'generate_log_data_job%';"

# If jobs are not running, restart the system
./webtop.sh restart
```

#### 3. Slow Dashboard Performance

**Problem**: The monitoring dashboard is slow to update or respond.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check database performance
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM timescaledb_information.job_stats WHERE proc_name IN ('policy_refresh_continuous_aggregate');"

# Adjust continuous aggregate refresh policy if needed
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres -c "SELECT alter_job(1234, schedule_interval => '5 minutes');"  # Replace 1234 with actual job_id
```

#### 4. Missing Top Websites in Election Results

**Problem**: The top websites report is empty or not updating.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if election jobs are running
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres -c "SELECT job_id, proc_name, schedule_interval FROM timescaledb_information.jobs WHERE proc_name LIKE 'populate_website_candidates_job%';"

# If jobs are not running, restart the election process
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres -c "SELECT schedule_website_tracking_jobs();"
```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check Docker Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker logs timescaledb
   ```

2. **Connect to Database Directly**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres
   ```

3. **Verify Database Schema**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if tables exist
   \dt
   
   -- Check if functions exist
   \df
   ```

4. **Reset the System**:
   If all else fails, you can reset the entire system:
   ```bash
   ./webtop.sh reset
   ./webtop.sh start
   ```

## Extending the System

### Adding Custom Traffic Patterns

You can add custom traffic patterns by modifying the `data-generation.sql` file:

1. Define a new function for your traffic pattern
2. Add a job scheduling call in the `setup_traffic_patterns()` function
3. Restart the system to apply changes

### Customizing the Election Process

To modify how top websites are elected:

1. Edit the `election.sql` file
2. Adjust the scoring algorithm in the `elect_top_websites()` function
3. Run `./webtop.sh setup-db` to apply changes

### Adding New Metrics

To add new metrics to the monitoring dashboard:

1. Create a new continuous aggregate in `pipeline.sql`
2. Add a new view in `main.sql`
3. Update the monitoring dashboard query in `webtop.sh`
